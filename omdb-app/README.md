# Unit 1 Project: OMDb app

## Approach Taken
My goal was to showcase one actor's work, pulling movie information from the OMDb API. The site would include one complex UI item, and would be also be a responsive site usable on small or large screen sizes.

## Technologies Used
For an API, I chose to use **OMDb**. I set up several event listeners on buttons the user could select to list the different movie data pulled via AJAX requests.
My complex UI item is an **carousel**.  I pulled 4 images of the showcased actor and set up a carousel through which a user can flip forward and backward.
In order to make my site responsive, I used two main CSS tools:  **flexbox** and **@media query** to set sites that were similar to each other, yet more appropriate for given screen sizes.
To style my app, I referenced the [**Color Picker**](https://www.w3schools.com/colors.colors_picker.asp) on W3Schools' website.  I also used [**Google Fonts**](https://fonts.google.com) to identify the font families with which to style my app.
At the start of my project, I created a wireframe using **MockFlow**(https://mockflow.com).  I was able to draw up the elements needed to layout my app, both in mobile and desktop modes.  This was helpful to creating my HTML and CSS.

## UNSOLVED PROBLEMS
One of my stretch goals was to alter the AJAX request to pull all the movies the actor was in for a specific decade.  I tried to use the filters to draw more detailed and numerous data objects, however, I was unsuccessful.
